### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later recommended)
-   `npm` or your favorite package manager
-   A Google AI API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application runs on two development servers: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit flows.

    -   **Terminal 1: Start the Next.js app:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the frontend on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    -   **Terminal 2: Start the Genkit flows:**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This will start the Genkit development server, which the Next.js app communicates with for AI features.

You should now be able to access the application in your browser and start generating posts!
